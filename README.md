## The Medical Information 
Every time a person presents as a new patient in a doctor’s office or clinic, he or she has to complete forms requesting what is generally identical information. In many cases, this information is not transferred electronically from the patient to the medical office but rather forms are completed and the information manually entered in the electronic health record by office staff. This site allows a person to enter the information once and then make it available to the office staff of whichever physician the patient will be seeing. Due to HIPAA privacy concerns, the user only enters a user name and password. Therefore, even if security is breached, the hacker would not have any personal information with which to link the information to the user.

## Usage
To begin using this site, fork the code from github, run bundle install, type “rails s” and press "Enter".  You can then proceed to the appropriate local host (usually 3000 if using rails) and press “Enter”. The homepage will then be seen and one can choose to sign up (if this is the first time the site is being accessed) or log in (if the site has been visited before). Once you are logged in, there will be a choice to start entering information (which will lead to a page with blank areas to complete) or to edit information (which will lead you to a page containing the information that you have previously entered and allows the user to add in missing information or to modify information previously submitted, Once the information is either completed or modified, there will be an opportunity to review the information. This page can be copied and pasted onto a word processor document and presented upon arrival at the physician’s office. Finally, there is the opportunity to log out when the information is correct and if desired, copied.
